# Big-data-assignment
In each case, write a program implemented using Spark (either on AWS or your Databricks),  to:

  Find the 5 most frequent and 5 least frequent (but present)  bi-grams for your dataset (only letters, not the various other characters).  A bi-gram is 2 successive digits/letters/etc within a word.  For example, the string stevens has 6 (st, te, ev, ve, en, ns).  Assume that the data set is large enough so that bi-grams at the boundaries of nodes are not significant (most likely you will have only 1 mapper in any case since this is a very small data set, so it wonâ€™t be an issue.

Your submission should be copied into MSWord or pdf, and should include (in one file):

    Your Spark Program

   Minimum (5 least occurring bi-gram)

    Maximum (5 most commonly occurring bi-gram)
